# This script is used to set up the system for sending triggers to the 
# EEG collection software (e.g., Brain Vision Recorder). The script is 
# formed of a Prepare phase and a Run phase. The code is partially 
# based on a tutorial by Kate Stone, available at 
# https://stonekate.github.io/blog/opensesame

# The purpose of each trigger is described in README.txt.
