# This script is used to set up the system for sending triggers to the 
# EEG collection software (e.g., Brain Vision Recorder). The code is 
# in part based on a tutorial by Kate Stone, available at 
# https://stonekate.github.io/blog/opensesame, and on an answer 
# on StackOverflow by user 'quamrana', available at 
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/76829646/7050882. 
# 
# The code defines the function `send_trigger`, which should then 
# be used in inline scripts, as in the following example: 
# `send_trigger(1)`


import serial
import serial.tools.list_ports
import time

# set test mode to yes or no 
var.test_mode = "no" 

# If we are not in test mode...
if(var.test_mode == "no"):

    # Use the first available port 
    available_port = serial.tools.list_ports.comports()[0].device
    serialport = serial.Serial(available_port)
    
    # Send triggers to the port
    def send_trigger(trigger):
        serialport.write(trigger.to_bytes(length = 1, byteorder = 'big'))
        time.sleep(0.01) # separation from next trigger (see Brain Vision Recorder manual)
        serialport.write(int(0).to_bytes(length = 1, byteorder = 'big')) # reset port
        return;
    
# When in test mode, show warning at the beginning of the experiment.
else:
    test_canvas = Canvas(color = 'red', font_size = 38, font_family = 'sans');
    test_canvas.text("The experiment is running in test mode.<br/><br/>No triggers will be sent.<br/><br/>(change test_mode in trigger_setup).");
    test_canvas.show();
    my_keyboard = Keyboard();
    key, end_time = my_keyboard.get_key();
    
    # In the `send_trigger` function, only print the triggers
    def send_trigger(trigger):
        print(trigger)
        time.sleep(0.01) # separation from next trigger (see Brain Vision Recorder manual)
        print(0)
